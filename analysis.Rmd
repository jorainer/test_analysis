title: "Identification of features with difference in abundances between group a and b"

## Introduction

Goal of the analysis is to...

```{r}
library(pander)

dta <- read.table("test_analysis/experiment_data.txt", sep = "\t", header = TRUE)
```

We have abundance estimated for `r nrow(dta)` features in `r ncol(dta)` samples.

## Exploratory analysis

Next we evaluate signal distribution of the features in the samples.

```{r}
boxplot(dta)
```

...
